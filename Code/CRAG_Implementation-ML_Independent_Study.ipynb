      "1. **Complement Your Major**: Look for pathways that enhance your major. For example, if you are a Biology major, consider a pathway in Spanish to improve your communication skills in a diverse environment. Similarly, Accounting majors might benefit from a Global Studies pathway.\n",

      "6. **Active Reflection**: Engage in active reflection to narrow down your career choices. This process is akin to solving a jigsaw puzzle, where you need to find the right pieces that fit together to form a complete picture of your career aspirations.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Career Discovery Resources**: Utilize resources like the Career Discovery Specialization offered by the University System of Georgia, which can help you explore different career paths and make informed decisions about your course selections.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Review Course Syllabi**: When selecting courses, ensure they align with your interests and career path by reviewing the course syllabi. This will give you insight into what to expect and how the course content relates to your goals.\n",

      "Generation: To identify spam, consider the following tips based on common characteristics of spam messages:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Impersonation Emails**: Be cautious of emails that impersonate legitimate companies, especially those claiming there are issues with your accounts (e.g., Amazon or Apple).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Robocalls**: Watch out for automated calls that claim there is trouble with your accounts or services.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Website Pop-ups**: Be wary of pop-ups that claim your computer is infected and prompt you to call \"tech support.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Infected Email Attachments**: Avoid opening attachments from unknown or suspicious sources, as they may contain malware.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Fake Invoices**: Be skeptical of unexpected invoices, especially if they come from unfamiliar companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Verify the Sender**: Always double-check the \"from\" address in an email. Ensure it matches what you expect, especially for important communications.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Check Links Before Clicking**: Hover over links to see their destination before clicking. If the link does not lead to a legitimate site (e.g., a Marist service), consider it suspicious.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Protect your accounts with MFA, especially for online financial services. This adds an extra layer of security.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these guidelines, you can better protect yourself from spam and potential phishing attempts.\n",

By filing the FAFSA, federal loans can be maximized at lower interest rates.
