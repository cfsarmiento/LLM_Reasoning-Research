# LLM Reasoning Research
 Machine Learning Independent Study research project centered around organizing the chain of reasoning a large language model may use with RAG and knowledge graphs, done in the Fall 2024 semeseter at Marist College - School of Computer Science & Math. Advised by Dr. Eitel Lauria.
