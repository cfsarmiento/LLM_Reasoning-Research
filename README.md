# LLM Reasoning Research
Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a growing area of interest in machine learning (ML) and large language models (LLM) for its ability to improve reasoning by grounding responses in relevant contexts. This study analyzes two RAG architectures, RAG’s original design and Corrective RAG. Through a detailed examination of these architectures, their components, and performance, this work underscores the
need for robust metrics when assessing RAG architectures and highlights the importance of good quality context documents in building systems that can mitigate LLM limitations, providing valuable insight for academic institutions to design efficient and accurate question-answering systems tailored to institutional needs.

Machine Learning Independent Study research project, done in the Fall 2024 semeseter at Marist University - School of Computer Science & Math. Advised by Dr. Eitel J.M Lauría.
